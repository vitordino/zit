### non-goals for v1

1. be feature-rich â€” like [git-up](https://gitup.co/)
2. have github or any other host-specific logic

### acknowledgements

huge props for the zed folks to come up with a brilliant piece of technology,
and also [atom](https://atom-editor.cc/) for guiding a lot of the initial ux sketches.

this repo is also a playground for some personal libraries like [`zedwind`](https://github.com/vitordino/zedwind) and [`reduxtron`](https://github.com/vitordino/reduxtron).
